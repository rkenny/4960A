Research into the applicability of several ML algorithms for OpeNTF.
They are:

BCGN (https://github.com/cjx0525/BGCN)

BundleGT (https://github.com/Xiaohao-Liu/BundleGT)

CrossCBR (https://github.com/mysbupt/CrossCBR/)

MIDGN (https://github.com/Snnzhao/MIDGN.git)

Code Structure:
Each of the above papers have their Git repos cloned into a directory of the same name.
There is another directory, Data, which contains a python script that remaps the OpeNTF data sets into a format that works for BCGN, BundleGT, CrossCBR and MIDGN.
