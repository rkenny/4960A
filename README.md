Research into the applicability of several ML algorithms for OpeNTF.
They are:
SUGER (https://github.com/Zhang-Zhenning/SUGER)
BCGN (https://github.com/cjx0525/BGCN)
BundleGT (https://github.com/Xiaohao-Liu/BundleGT0
CrossCBR (https://github.com/mysbupt/CrossCBR/)
MIDGN (https://github.com/Snnzhao/MIDGN.git)
and, Steam-bundle-recommendation (https://github.com/technoapurva/Steam-Bundle-Recommendation)

Code Structure:
Each of the above papers have their Git repos cloned into a directory of the same name.
There is another directory, Data, which contains a python script that remaps the OpeNTF data sets into a format that works for BCGN, BundleGT, CrossCBR and MIDGN. SUGER and Steam-bundle-recommendation remapping is underway.
