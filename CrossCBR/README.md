## Introduction
CrossCBR is a new recommendation model based on graph neural network and contrastive learning for bundle recommendation. By explicitly modeling the cooperative association between the item-view and bundle-view representations using an auxiliary contrastive loss, CrossCBR achieves great performance on three public bundle recommendation datasets: Youshu, NetEase, and iFashion.

## Requirements
* OS: Ubuntu 18.04 or higher version
* python == 3.7.3 or above
* supported(tested) CUDA versions: 10.2
* Pytorch == 1.9.0 or above


## Code Structure
1. The entry script for training and evaluation is: [train.py](https://github.com/mysbupt/CrossCBR/blob/master/train.py).
2. The config file is: [config.yaml](https://github.com/mysbupt/CrossCBR/blob/master/config.yaml).
3. The script for data preprocess and dataloader: [utility.py](https://github.com/mysbupt/CrossCBR/blob/master/utility.py).
4. The model folder: [./models](https://github.com/mysbupt/CrossCBR/tree/master/models).
5. The experimental logs in tensorboard-format are saved in ./runs.
6. The experimental logs in txt-format are saved in ./log.
7. The best model and associate config file for each experimental setting is saved in ./checkpoints.

## How to run the code
1. Decompress the dataset file into the current folder: 

   > tar -zxvf dataset.tgz
 
   Noted: for the iFashion dataset, we incorporate three additional files: user\_id\_map.json, item\_id\_map.json, and bundle\_id\_map.json, which record the id mappings between the original string-formatted id in the POG dataset and the integer-formatted id in our dataset. You may use the mappings to obtain the original content information of the items/outfits. We do not use any content information in this work.

2. Train CrossCBR on the dataset Youshu with GPU 0: 

   > python train.py -g 0 -m CrossCBR -d Youshu

   You can specify the gpu id and the used dataset by cmd line arguments, while you can tune the hyper-parameters by revising the configy file [config.yaml](https://github.com/mysbupt/CrossCBR/blob/master/config.yaml). The detailed introduction of the hyper-parameters can be seen in the config file, and you are highly encouraged to read the paper to better understand the effects of some key hyper-parameters.
